FERRIE(m):I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating. 
JIM(m):Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory? 
FERRIE(m):Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad. 
JIM(m):I see.  And where did you drive? 
FERRIE(m):We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there. 
JIM(m):Why Galveston? 
FERRIE(m):No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere. 
JIM(m):And then Sunday? 
FERRIE(m):In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond. 
JIM(m):Did you bag any geese on this trip? 
FERRIE(m):I believe the boys got a couple. 
JIM(m):But the boys told us they didn't get any. 
FERRIE(m):Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds. 
JIM(m):Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun? 
FERRIE(m):Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
